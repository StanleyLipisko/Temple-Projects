We will be using Idle. Some features it will have is food rations, survival game aspects, storyline, (graphics maybe but unlikely because I don’t know how to use C#). It will be execute throughout Idle. 

TODO

4.If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course? 
Not combing with another course. 

TODO, if applicable

5.If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

6.In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what? 
Food rations where you have to disperse food and water to survive. After every turn it tells you how many rations we have for everyday. Have an actual ending. 

TODO

7.In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I think it should have Multiple endings, Randomized events throughout turns and some survival type aspects. 

TODO

8.In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
An unlock progression system, replayability, graphics, and a good storyline. 

TODO

9.In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what? 
Some skill we will need is knowing how to program how random events will play, how characters names will show up, and maybe if we can try to make it have graphics. Topics we will need to research are good story plots and maybe how to do graphics.  We are working on this at the same time so we don’t know yet but we probably will separate the work so not one person does everything.
